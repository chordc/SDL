# Exploring Symbolic Deep Learning

**SDL** is a course project of [《Machine learning for physicists》](https://github.com/wangleiphy/ml4p). The goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness of combining traditional **symbolic models** with **deep learning**.  

The content includes sharing literature reading and some code demos, which we will gradually put in the repository.  

Finally, we will initially test our **SDL** on well-known physical models that have established formulas to describe interactions, as well as use our algorithm on physical models that are less certain and require further exploration.

## Background
- [Symbolic regression (SR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression) is a type of a supervised machine learning technique that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given datase. However, the [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) is considered essentially a brute force procedure[[1]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1165893) which scale exponentially with the number of input variables and operators[[2]]().

>Deep learning methods allow efficient training of complex models on highdimensional datasets...

>...train a Networks in a supervised setting, then apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations.

## Example Readmes

- We will gradually put in the repository.     
  Our work is gonna to extend the package of  [Tenachi et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03192) base on some algorithms of RL. e.g. A2C, Reward shaping...

- We recommend using the following Python packages: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [pyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) and [jax](https://github.com/google/jax).
